<h3>Development Info</h3>
Contributions are welcomed and encouraged!

The git project is at:
<pre>git clone git://sd30.intel.com/proxy-setup.git</pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>
The script is known to work on these operating systems. It probably
works on a lot more, too.

If you have
success in using it elsewhere, please let me know so I can add you to
the list.
<ul>
    <li>Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</li>
</ul>

Note: <code>--verbose</code> is currently unimplemented, but this fact
is not reported. Curious users are encouraged to run the command via:

<pre>bash -x ./proxy-setup.sh</pre>
