Globocorp Proxy Setup Script
============================

-   Save time setting up Linux machines at Globocorp;
-   Consolidate BKMs for proxying into one script.

### Download and Run

        git clone git@github.com:jamesonwilliams/proxy-setup.git
        sudo ./proxy-setup.sh --help 

### Testing

The script is known to work on these operating systems. It probably
works on a lot more, too. If you have success in using it elsewhere,
please let me know so I can add you to the list.

-   Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
-   Ubuntu **10**.04 LTS

### Development

Note: `--verbose` is currently unimplemented, but this fact is not
reported. Curious users are encouraged to run the command via:

    bash -x ./proxy-setup.sh

Contributions of any kind are welcomed and encouraged!
